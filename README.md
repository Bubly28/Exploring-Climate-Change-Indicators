# Exploring-Climate-Change-Indicators
This project, "Exploring Climate Change Indicators," examines various country-specific climate change indicators using data from the World Bank. The analysis involves data manipulation using pandas dataframes and statistical exploration to uncover trends and correlations. 

Key components of the project include: 

1. Data Ingestion and Manipulation:
   - Implemented a function to read World Bank data and return two dataframes: one with years as columns and another with countries as columns, including necessary cleaning and organization. 

2. Statistical Analysis:
   - Investigated statistical properties of indicators such as CO2 production, GDP, arable land, and forest coverage.
   - Utilized the `.describe()` method and additional statistical techniques to provide summary statistics and cross-country comparisons. 

3. Correlation and Trend Analysis:
   - Analyzed correlations between indicators, such as the relationship between population growth and energy consumption, observing variations across different countries and time periods.
   - Identified significant trends and changes, offering insights into the interactions of climate change indicators. 

4. Visualizations and Narrative:
   - Created visualizations using time series plots and other appropriate methods to effectively present findings.
   - Provided a narrative that interprets the results, highlighting key insights and trends. 

This project demonstrates robust data manipulation skills, thorough statistical analysis, and effective use of visualization tools. The Python code follows PEP-8 guidelines and best programming practices, ensuring clarity and reusability.
